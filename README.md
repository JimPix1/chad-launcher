# chad-launcher
A dmenu script for launching games.

Note that this patch utilises the grid patch and will be necessary to use the script.
My own dmenu build can be found [here](https://github.com/JimPix1/dotfiles). You can add the patch to your own build [here](https://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/patches/grid).
